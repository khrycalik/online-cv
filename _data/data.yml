    title: Career Profile
    summary: |
      As part of my professional development and personal interests, I continuously learn about AI/ML. I utilize internal training systems at work and dedicate my free time to reading books such as the excellent publication "Hands-on Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras, and TensorFlow" by Aurélien Géron.
      My interest in this field began during the preparation of my engineering thesis, where I utilized genetic algorithms with the support of the Ares supercomputer to analyze their functionality and the impact of model modifications on solving the traveling salesman problem and the knapsack problem.

      - role: Software Developer
        time: 2021 - Present
        company: Ericsson
        details: |
          Currently, I am working on one of Ericsson's 5G key projects called Booster Carrier Sleep. It enables dynamic and autonomous activation and deactivation of carriers based on traffic demand.
          This software is a key factor in enabling energy efficiency.
          As one of the most competent teams in the 5G Traffic Control (TC) domain, we have been assigned to work on the design and implementation of a solution in this sector.
          Regarding my responsibilities, as a member of the Cross Functional Team (XFT), I actively participate in preparing solution proposals, implementing, testing, and documenting them.
          Each of these stages is preceded by thorough analysis of documentation and code to create the best and most robust solutions. 
          As part of the implementation, I use <b>C++17</b>. Depending on the level, tests either utilize the Google Test framework or are written in Erlang. The main part of the documentation is written using plantUML.

          On a daily basis, I assume the additional role of a security master within the team. This role involves continuous self-improvement in the field of security, both in terms of writing secure code in compliance with SEI CERT standards and in terms of legal regulations, for example, related to the use of artificial intelligence or third-party products. I share this knowledge with the team to ensure that our code is highly resistant to various attacks and errors.

          At the beginning of 2024, I changed my additional role to the newly created ML (machine learning) master, which better suits my interests. As part of my development in this area, at the beginning of March I started a 15-week course conducted by specialists from AGH University of Science and Technology in cooperation with Ericsson.

        link: https://github.com/khrycalik/Engineering-Thesis?tab=readme-ov-file
        tagline: The project analyzed how changes in genetic algorithm parameters and methods affect the outcome. Both the traveling salesman problem and the knapsack problem were examined, and the computations were performed on the Ares supercomputer to achieve the objectives. The program that performs these tasks was written in Python and utilizes the numpy and pandas libraries.

        tagline: This project includes exercises from each chapter of the book to enhance understanding and reinforce what I have learned. These tasks were solved in a Jupyter Notebook environment using Scikit-learn, Keras, and TensorFlow frameworks.

      - title: Ericsson Booster Carrier Sleep 5G
        link: https://www.ericsson.com/en/ran/massive-mimo
        tagline: One of the Ericsson's 5G key projects, Booster Carrier Sleep allows carriers to be switched on and off dynamically based on the traffic demand. This software creates more opportunities for cell sleep and radio deep sleep to be activated autonomously, being a key enabler for energy efficiency. As part of the implementation, I use C++17. Depending on the level, tests either utilize the Google Test framework or are written in Erlang. The main part of the documentation is written using plantUML.
